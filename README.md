# Sorting-and-searching-algorithms
simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands
## Description

The program allows the user to input the size of an integer array and then input the elements of the array. Afterward, it sorts the array using the insertion sort algorithm and displays the sorted array.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have a Pascal compiler installed on your system, such as Free Pascal.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Compile the program using your Pascal compiler. For example, if you're using Free Pascal.

4. Run the compiled program:

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the array size and input the array elements.

6. The program will then sort the array using the insertion sort algorithm and display the sorted result.

## Example

Here's an example of how the program works:
Taille de tableau :
5
T[1] = 5
T[2] = 2
T[3] = 9
T[4] = 1
T[5] = 5
Sorted array:
1
2
5
5
9
